I am thinking of you right now. But even more than that, the One who fashioned your heart is watching over you with more love than a mother has for her child. You are never a 'burden' and you are never forgotten.",
                comfort: "This Ayah is a divine promise. It means that in your darkest room, in your loneliest thought, Allah is present. You aren't just existing alone; you are being looked after by the Creator of the Universe."

You don't have to figure out the next ten years today; you just have to get through the next ten minutes. Give yourself permission to be human. You are allowed to rest.",
